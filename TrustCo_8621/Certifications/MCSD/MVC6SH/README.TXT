2.  Potential Problems During Setup

The Setup program's default settings will load the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here title to drive C. Complete Setup will copy up to 16MB of data to your hard drive; Typical Setup (without example code) will copy 13 MB of data to your hard drive.

Setup will not complete properly if you remove the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here CD-ROM during Setup, or attempt to start the application before Setup is complete.

Because Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here installs system files that may be shared with other applications, you must shut down other applications, including Microsoft Office, before running Setup. If you have closed all other open applications and you encounter problems during Setup, make sure your system meets the minimum requirements (see below) necessary to install Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here.

You must have the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here CD-ROM in your CD-ROM drive to run the program. Before running setup for Visual C++ 6.0, you must shut down all applications, including Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here.

Note: When prompted to enter a company name during setup, please enter some text: under some circumstances a blank company name can cause a problem during uninstall.

System Requirements

To use Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here, you need:

- MPC2-compatible PC with a 486DX/66 Mhz or higher processor (Pentium or higher processor recommended)
- Microsoft Windows 95 or later or Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 or later
- 16 MB of RAM for Windows 95 or later; 24 MB for Windows NT Workstation
- Minimum 13 MB of available hard-disk space; 16 MB if you install the example code
- MPC2-compatible CD-ROM drive
- VGA or higher-resolution monitor; Super VGA (in 16-bit color or higher resolution) recommended

Performance will improve with more RAM or a faster CD-ROM drive.


3.  Removing Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here

To remove Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here from your computer, run Setup again and choose the Remove option. Alternatively, you can uninstall Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here by choosing the Add/Remove Programs application in the Control Panel. You may also need to do the following:

- Delete the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here icon. If you are running Microsoft Windows NT and moved the icon to a different program group since installing the application, Setup will not be able to detect the new location of the icon and cannot delete it. After running Setup (with Remove selected), go to Windows NT Explorer and delete the icon(s).

- Delete the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here shortcut. If you are running Windows and have created a shortcut, you will need to manually delete them to completely remove references to the title.

- Delete the MVC6SH directory. If the MVC6SH directory (or the directory you specified as the destination directory during Setup) did not uninstall, you can delete it in Windows Explorer by selecting the directory, and then pressing DELETE. Do not delete the directory if it is being used for another application's files.

Note: If you encounter problems while attempting to uninstall Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here, re-install the application and confirm that something is entered in the 'Company' field, then run uninstall again. 


4.  Potential Problems Running this Title

This section describes problems you may experience when running Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here.

Graphics

This title is designed to run on machines capable of displaying High Color (16 bit). Though the title does run on systems displaying 16 colors, there is a noticeable drop in image quality. At a 640x480 resolution some large graphics may display outside the desktop. It is recommended that you run this application at a 800x600 or greater resolution.  To change your display resolution, choose Display from the Control Panel.

Help

If you don't install the MSDN Library shipped with Visual C++ 6.0, you will not be able to access Visual C++ 6.0 Help while running Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here (unless you have two CD-ROM drives). If the Visual C++ 6.0 Help files are not installed in the default installation directory, the executable tags in the topics that launch VC++ Help will not work. If MSDN is not installed on Windows NT 4.0 without Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, the executable tags will not return any error message at all. 

Media

When running media at a 640x480 resolution, you will need to hide your Windows taskbar in order to use the video controls located at the bottom of the video viewer. Running media at an 800x600 or greater resolution will also remedy this problem.

Navigation and Topic Areas

You can use keyboard keys to move through the Contents and Topic areas (using the View menu Topic Only and Navigation & Topic commands). However, if you are in the Navigation & Topic view, you will need a mouse pointer to switch to the Topic side of the application. If you are in either view, you will need a mouse pointer to select Topic area content (including multimedia elements, pop-up windows, Self-Check answers), and to move through the content by clicking the vertical scroll bars. On some systems, the scroll bars may change size when you scroll through the material.

Palette Flash

Palette flashes can occur when switching between Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here and other running applications.

Printing

The media (graphics, sample code, tips, and answers) represented by icons in the text area will not print when you are printing the current screen, but will print when media is displayed in an active window. To print this information, click the media icon to open the active window and choose the File menu Print command. If you experience problems printing over a network, consult your network administrator to make sure your printer settings are correct. Solutions for common printing problems are described in section 8, Printing Problems.


Text

Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here uses your system settings to display some foreground and background colors. You may want to choose a compatible display combination (such as the Windows Standard color scheme) for best visual results. When displaying pop-up windows within the text, the application will sometimes lose focus. To remedy this, click in the topic area; focus will return to the application.

Video

.AVI files will run only if you've installed Active Movie. If you do not already have Active Movie installed, or have an older version of Active Movie installed, Setup will install it for you. With low-end hardware such as a 486 machine or 1x/2x CD-ROM drive, you may experience long wait times while video files are being loaded, and you may encounter errors in audio and video synchronization during playback.


5.  Labs and Sample Applications

Labs

Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here provides lab exercises that illustrate programming concepts and techniques. These Try It Now and Try It Yourself sections are found within topics and listed at the end of the relevant section in the table of contents, as well as in the drop-down list under Labs. To run the example code provided on the CD-ROM, you must have Visual C++ 6.0 and IE 4.01 (SP1a) installed on your computer.

Example Code

If you chose a Complete installation during Setup, example code files are installed to the \Learnvcn folder on your hard drive. If you chose a Typical installation, the example code will not be copied to your local drive; you can view the files in the \Examples\Learnvcn folder on the CD-ROM.


6.  Performance Issues

There are several ways to make Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here run faster. Many of the methods described below are general tips that will improve the performance of any Windows-based application. Consult your Windows documentation for more details.

Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here uses your computer's random access memory (RAM) to display pictures and play video and audio. If Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here runs slowly or if you get error messages stating you are out of memory, you may not have enough RAM available. Here are some tips to make the best use of your available memory:

- Close all applications that you are not using.

- Add more RAM to your computer.  You can determine how much memory is available by right-clicking the My Computer icon on your desktop and selecting Properties.  The resulting dialog will tell you how much memory you have.  You need at least 16 MB of RAM for Windows 95 or later, 24 MB for Windows NT or later.

- If you are using more than 256 colors in your video display, you may want to lower your video colors to 256. For instructions on how to change your Windows display, consult your Windows documentation.

For more details on improving performance, consult your Windows and CD-ROM drive manuals.


7.  Potential Hardware Problems

In rare situations, Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here may encounter display problems when using accelerated video drivers, video drivers with more than 256 colors, or high-resolution video drivers. One example of these problems is a video display with garbled images. Another is a crash occurring when trying to play a video. There are several things you can do if you encounter such problems:

- Most problems can be fixed by obtaining new drivers from your video card manufacturer. Contact the manufacturer of your video card to determine if newer versions are available. You may also obtain updated drivers through the Microsoft Download Service (MSDL), an electronic bulletin board that can be accessed by modem at (425)936-MSDL ((425)936-6735).

Drivers provided on MSDL are compressed with the PKWare(TM) utilities and are in the form of executable (.exe) files. It is best to download the file or files you need into an empty directory on your hard disk or a blank formatted floppy. To decompress these drivers after downloading them, either:

- From Windows Explorer, double-click the filename that you downloaded.

-or-

- From the MS-DOS prompt, change to the directory containing the downloaded file, type the filename, and then press ENTER.

An alternative to obtaining a new or updated display driver is to change your video mode to a standard video mode, such as a 640x480 resolution with 256 colors.

To find out what video driver you are using, in the Control Panel, click Display, the Settings tab, and then the Change Display Type button. Your display type will be listed there. For instructions on how to install or change drivers, click F1 or use Windows Help.


8.  Potential Printing Problems

Screen resolution and printer resolution are often not the same, so the resulting printout may not match the quality you see on the screen.

If you encounter a general protection fault when you print a topic, check your printer driver. Switch to a more current version of the driver, if one is available. Additionally, ensure that the printer is online and that you can print to it from another application. If the problem persists, one of the following procedures may solve the problem:

In Windows NT:

In the Control Panel, double-click the Fonts icon. Click the TrueType button in the Fonts dialog box, and turn off the Enable TrueType Fonts option.

In the Control Panel, choose Setup and Options for your printer. Turn off the Color option, and restart Windows.


In Windows 95 or later:

Click the File menu Print command, and then the Properties button for the printer you are using. Click the Fonts tab and select the method of downloading TrueType fonts that works best with your system.

If you are using an HP LaserJet printer, make sure that you have the most current printer driver, or try setting the printer resolution to 300 dpi (graphics may not print properly at 600 dpi).

You should be able to print grayscale images from Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here. If you have a black-and-white laser printer, you may need to upgrade your printer driver. Call the dealer from whom you bought the printer or call the printer manufacturer.

Chapter 13 Readme.txt 

There is no sample code for chapter 13.  You may or may not
choose to implement the code change in the Fixing the Bug
section of the chapter.  Chapter 14 implements a different 
solution to the problem, and will replace the code edits 
in Chapter 13.

However, Chapter 13 is an excellent tutorial on the 
Visual C++ debugger.  I highly recommend that you study
this chapter if you are not familiar with the debugger.

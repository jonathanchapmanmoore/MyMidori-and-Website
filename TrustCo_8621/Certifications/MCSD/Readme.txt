WHAT'S ON THIS CD?
==================

This companion CD contains sample exam questions and files used in the 
hands-on labs and exercises in the text, and the multimedia title 
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here. For detailed instructions on 
how to install the software you need to complete the exercises and labs, 
refer to the DAVC Installation Instructions document in the root of this CD.


HOW TO USE THE CD
=================

Using the Lab Files
-------------------

The lab files are included in the \DAVC folder of the CD. To copy the lab 
files to your hard drive, run the setup.exe program in the root of the CD
and follow the instructions that appear on your screen. By default, the lab 
files are copied to the \DAVC folder. Each chapter in the book has its own 
subfolder. (For example, material relating to Chapter 1 can be found in 
\DAVC\Chapter 1.) Each of these folders might contain the following subfolders:

	The \Code folder contains source files and code snippets that you can 
	use as you complete the labs or exercises in the lessons. 

	The \Data folder contains other data files that you will use in the 
	course of developing and testing the lab.

	The \Exercises folder contains files related to the exercises 
	in the lessons.

	The \Lab folder contains project files for the labs that appear at 
	the end of each chapter. Each \Lab folder might have the following subfolders:

		The \Partial folder contains the application as it looks at the 
		beginning of each lab.

		The \Solution folder contains a completed version of the lab solution. 

	Beneath the DAVC folder is the \Database folder, which contains files 
	that you use to set up the database used by the labs.

	
Self Test Software Visual C++ 6.0 Sample Exam
---------------------------------------------

The Self Test Software demonstration for exam 70-016 is located in the
\Exam folder. To install the sample exam to your hard drive, run the
mp016.exe program in this folder and follow the instructions that appear
on your screen.



Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here
------------------------------------

The Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts Here multimedia title is located in the 
\MVC6SH folder. To install the product to your hard drive, run the Setup.exe 
program in this folder.

The Setup program's default settings will load the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Starts 
Here title to drive C. Complete Setup will copy up to 16MB of data to your hard drive; 
Typical Setup (without example code) will copy 13 MB of data to your hard drive.

For more information, refer to the Readme.txt file in the \MVC6SH folder.


SUPPORT INFORMATION
===================

Troubleshooting
---------------
 - Long filenames on companion CD.

Older, 16-bit CD-ROM drives might not recognize long filenames on CD.
If you experience problems viewing all of the files on this companion CD, 
contact your CD-ROM drive manufacturer for an updated driver.

 - Note that manually copying sample files from the companion CD to your 
hard drive requires resetting each file's read-only attribute.
